--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.FebSales limit 3;
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers limit 3;

--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
JOIN customers ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales limit 3;
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price   FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE price IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)    ;

 --5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?   
 SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales limit 3;
 SELECT (SUM(Quantity))*price AS 'Revenue', product
 FROM JanSales
 WHERE product <> ''
 AND product <> 'Product'
 GROUP BY Product;
 
--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue? 
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.FebSales limit 3;
SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product,SUM(Quantity)*Price as 'Revenue'
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT count(distinct acctnum), avg(quantity)*price FROM customers
LEFT JOIN FebSales ON order_id = orderid
WHERE quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

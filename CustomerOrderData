--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.FebSales limit 3;
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers limit 3;

--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
JOIN customers ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales limit 3;
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price   FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE price IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)    ;

 --5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?   
 SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales limit 3;
 SELECT (SUM(Quantity))*price AS 'Revenue', product
 FROM JanSales
 WHERE product <> ''
 AND product <> 'Product'
 GROUP BY Product;
 
--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue? 
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.FebSales limit 3;
SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product,SUM(Quantity)*Price as 'Revenue'
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT count(distinct acctnum), avg(quantity)*price FROM customers
LEFT JOIN FebSales ON order_id = orderid
WHERE quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'; 

--8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold. 
select product, sum(quantity) from febsales
where location like '%Los Angeles%'
group by product;

--9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? 
select location, count(orderid)

--10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
select sum(quantity) as quantity, product
from febsales

group by product;

--11. What was the average amount spent per account in February? 
--(Hints: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account. 
--To multiply, you can use the * symbol, and to divide, you can use the / symbol.)
select (sum(quantity)*sum(price))/count(acctnum)  as 'Average spent per account in February'

where length(orderid) = 6 and orderid <> 'Order ID';

--12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 
--(Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).
select sum(quantity)/count(acctnum)  as 'Average quantity of products purchased per account in February'
from febsales left join customers on orderID = order_id
where length(orderid) = 6 and orderid <> 'Order ID';

--13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total? 
select product, (sum(quantity))*(sum(price)) as 'revenue'
